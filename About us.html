<a class="story1">"I didn't dream about making any games, but my goal is to entertain people. It was then my friend named Loyalas0 planned to make a game - I knew I had an opportunity, both Loyalas0 and another friend named WhatThePanPan knew how to script so they became our scripters of ML studio. We think that we will have a great future by making games!"</a>

<a class="story2">"I've always wanted to make games. That was then I created the studio we all know as ML Studio! Soon after we decided to start a game called the "family friendly gaem". Me and Mehmet has been working on the game for quite a while, and when Panda joined he adapted quickly and found out how to script better in Lua. Panda has been a great help to us and we may even call him our leading scripter!"</a>

<a class="story3">"When I first got invited to ML studio, I never knew we would make games. I just thought it was just something for fun; like a group, or a hang out. They said they were making a game so I decided to help on their game, I also made this website to help them!"</a>
